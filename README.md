# Front Controller Website

**Front Controller Website** is an educational Java web project that implements the *Front Controller* architectural pattern within the MVC model. It demonstrates how to centrally process HTTP requests and route them to appropriate handlers.

## 📐 Architecture

The project is built on the following principles:

- **Front Controller**: All incoming requests are handled through a single controller, providing a centralized entry point

- **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: Generates dynamic HTML content
